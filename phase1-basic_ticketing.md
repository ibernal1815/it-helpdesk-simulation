# Phase 1 — Basic Ticketing

This first phase was all about getting the **Spiceworks Cloud Help Desk** up and running.  
I treated it like day one in a new IT support role — just learning the ropes, figuring out the workflow, and making sure tickets actually flow in and out cleanly.

---

## 🎯 What I Set Up
- Created my **Spiceworks Cloud Help Desk** account  
- Connected an **email inbox** so messages turn into tickets  
- Made categories for the most common request types:  
  - Password / Account  
  - VPN / Network  
  - Hardware / Laptop  
  - Software / Access  
- Added **custom fields** for:
  - Department  
  - Device Type  
  - Urgency

## 🧩 Sample Tickets
I created a few example tickets to practice triage and resolution:
| Ticket ID | Title | Category | Priority | Status |
|------------|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| HD-001 | Password Reset – HR User | Accounts | Medium | Resolved |
| HD-002 | VPN Failing to Connect | Network | High | In Progress |
| HD-003 | New Laptop Setup | Hardware | Low | Closed |

Each one went through the basic flow: **Open → Assigned → Resolved → Closed**.

## 💬 What I Learned
Setting up the structure matters more than I expected.  
Once categories and fields are clean, every ticket after that feels easier to handle.

It also showed me how **consistency** helps — like naming conventions for tickets and using templates for replies.

## 📸 Screenshots
All screenshots are stored under `/assets/` for this phase:
1. `01_ticket_form.png` — Example of ticket form with custom fields  
2. `02_ticket_list.png` — Filtered ticket list by category  
3. `03_ticket_details.png` — A resolved ticket view  

(Any personal info or email addresses are blurred.)

## 🪴 Next Steps
Phase 2 will start automating what I did manually here:
- Auto-assign tickets by category  
- Set up SLAs for urgent ones  
- Add quick-reply templates

**Reflection:**  
> “At this stage, the focus wasn’t being fast — it was being structured.  
> A clean ticket flow saves more time than any fancy automation later.”

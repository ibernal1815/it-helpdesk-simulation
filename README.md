# Spiceworks Help Desk – 5 Phase Learning Project

This project is my hands-on journey setting up and growing a small help desk using **Spiceworks Cloud Help Desk**.  
I treated it like a mini IT support department and built it out in stages — each one a bit more advanced than the last.

It’s not a giant system. It’s a compact, real-world lab that shows what someone with 1–2 years of help desk experience would actually do day-to-day: manage tickets, automate the small stuff, document fixes, and track what’s working.

## 🧭 The Goal
To show practical IT support and service desk skills in a way that’s visible on GitHub — through screenshots, configuration notes, and reflection.

I used this setup to:
- Learn how a ticketing system really fits into IT operations  
- Practice triaging, prioritizing, and resolving requests  
- Automate workflows to save time  
- Track SLAs and analyze ticket data  
- Gather feedback and improve the experience

## ⚙️ Tools
- **Spiceworks Cloud Help Desk** (Free cloud version)  
- **Markdown** for documentation  
- **Google Sheets / Excel** for metrics  
- **Python (optional)** for small data visualizations  
- **GitHub** for sharing everything cleanly

## 🪜 Project Phases

### **Phase 1 — Basic Ticketing**
> _“Get it running and keep it organized.”_

- Set up the help desk, categories, and mailbox  
- Created test tickets (password reset, VPN issue, printer jam)  
- Added custom fields like *Department* and *Device Type*  
- Practiced resolving tickets and closing loops  

📸 **Screenshots:** Ticket form, category view, and sample resolved ticket  
🧩 **Skills:** Ticket intake, categorization, communication

### **Phase 2 — Workflow Automation**
> _“If I do it twice, it needs a rule.”_

- Added automations for keyword routing and SLA timers  
- Created an auto-response template for common issues  
- Built an escalation rule for high priority tickets  
- Measured how fast tickets were being responded to  

📸 **Screenshots:** Automation rule list, SLA config  
🧩 **Skills:** Process efficiency, rule creation, SLA awareness

### **Phase 3 — Knowledge Management**
> _“Write it once, reuse it forever.”_

- Logged common issues (VPN, password reset, printer setup)  
- Created markdown KB articles for each recurring issue  
- Linked articles to tickets so agents could reply faster  
- Updated templates when new edge cases appeared  

📸 **Screenshots:** KB entry view, ticket linked to KB  
🧩 **Skills:** Documentation, consistency, internal communication

---

### **Phase 4 — Analytics & Reporting**
> _“You can’t fix what you don’t measure.”_

- Exported ticket data and visualized metrics  
- Calculated average first response and resolution time  
- Created a dashboard for open vs. resolved tickets  
- Highlighted SLA breaches and peak request times  

📸 **Screenshots:** Dashboard overview, spreadsheet graph  
🧩 **Skills:** Data analysis, SLA tracking, reporting

---

### **Phase 5 — User Experience & Integration**
> _“Make it smoother for everyone.”_

- Added a quick satisfaction survey on ticket closure  
- Adjusted automations based on user feedback  
- Set up notification integration (Slack test webhook)  
- Wrote reflection notes on what improved most  

📸 **Screenshots:** Survey form, integration setup  
🧩 **Skills:** User feedback, continuous improvement, integrations
